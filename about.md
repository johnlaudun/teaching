# About

This site is designed to be available to course participants and interested others without having to negotiate LMS logins, or outages. It is built using Jekyll and is hosted in a [GitHub repository][]. 

For more information about me, John Laudun, I have a [website][jl].

For more information about the University of Louisiana, it too has a [website][ul]. 

For more information about GitHub â€¦ I think you know what to do.
