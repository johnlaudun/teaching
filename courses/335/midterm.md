# Midterm Writing Assignment

If you wish not to take the midterm exam, you may choose to answer the following writing prompt. You can turn the essay in at any time before the start of class on the day of exam. You must, however, notify me via the Moodle poll that you are choosing to write instead of sitting the exam.

## Prompt

At this point in the semester, we have read a half dozen articles, each of which has been an examination of a particular folk narrative form within a particular cultural context. Apply the analytical concerns of one article to the data of another. Be sure in your answer to make clear you understand the original context for both the analytical/theoretical approach upon which are drawing as well as the original context for the data upon which you are focused.

300-500 words (longer is better)
