# "Now There Is": What We Think When We Think about Machine Thinking

##### John Laudun

## Vision & Objectives

What does it mean for so many of us to be caught up in a collection of files that pass from one machine to another and are processed into other kinds of files? Is the invisibility of it all--and invisibility that is effectively magic--to us? In this course we take up the question of artificial intelligence, but not in the embodied form of robots and droids--e.g., Robbie or R2D2--but in the form of faceless, disembodied entities like UNIVAC or Deep Blue.

## Requirements

### Assignments

**Paper**. The final paper in this class asks you to reflect on the methodological work we have done in terms of understanding texts and the topical considerations for the term -- in this case how we imagine "artificial intelligence." Your objective is to complete by the end of the semester an essay which takes up a text, or several texts, that we did not discuss in class and examine it for its representation of how intelligences, human and artificial, relate, reflect, refract a particular concern, anxiety, question or some other topic of your choosing. The paper must be grounded in textual evidence and that evidence must be presented in a contextualized fashion and a considered sequence such that your audience is "naturally" led from your initial proposition to agreement with your thinking on the matter.
