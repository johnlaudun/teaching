## Course Description

The course is designed to introduce participants to the study of online vernacular cultures. As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address materials and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. The theory used in this course is a mixture of folklore studies, information science, cultural studies, and network studies. The objects of study are those forms of cultural expression that pass through offline and online social networks.

The goal of this course is to examine those materials as texts in and of themselves and to understand the sources, both structural and referential, upon which they draw. Social media is broadly imagined here: on of the foundations of the course is to highlight that all media, first, have always been social, and that, second, the social world has always been mediated. Because of the personal nature of much of social media, participants in this course will need to have an open mind about the nature of meaning, and, just as importantly, about the varieties of human experience and perception. Some of the material in this course reveals the anxieties and fears, the prejudices and blindnesses, that humans too often carry with them and rarely communicate directly, instead embedding them in stories and assertions that manifest what are often tangled knots of things thought and/or felt. In some cases, the knots are not pretty.


## Course Requirements

For matters of daily comportment and responsibility, please see [The Essentials](../../guides/essentials.md).

###  Texts

A great deal of the readings are scholarly in nature and will be available either as links to JSTOR and Project Muse or through the course’s Moodle site, either as PDFs or as links to sites. In addition to the on-line materials, there is at least one book required for this course.

Shifman, Limor. 2014. _Memes in Digital Culture_. MIT Press.

Please arrange to purchase the book through your preferred vendor. (Please make sure you have a complete version of the book and can access it readily.) Depending upon the make-up of the class and emergent interests, there may be a second book to purchase, so be sure to set aside a portion of your budget for that expense, in addition to the cost of printing other materials as needed.

### Assignments

The assignment schedule for this course is simple:

* **Participation** (30%). Half the participation grade is dependent upon your being in class and being an active part of discussions through active listening and thoughtful contributions. The other half of the participation grade is a function of a collection of small assignments: taking responsibility for a discussion, completion of in-class writing assignment, etc.
* **Mid-term essay/exam** (20%). At the mid-term, this course asks that you write an essay synthesizing your understanding of the study of vernacular culture based on the materials we have read and the discussions we have had. The essay must be well--structured and sourced. (Bonus points are awarded for quoting a fellow participant.)
* **Course Project** (50%). The course project requires independent enterprise on the part of course participants, who are free to choose from a wide variety of topics, so long as they can make a case to me both in the intial proposal and in the paper itself that it fits within the scope of the course. The wide possible scope is on purpose, but negotiating the parameters of the project with the instructor is *required*. For more, see the [course project](project-0.md) specifications page.


### Infrastructure

Students in this course will receive and submit assignments using either markdown-formatted plain text or LaTeX through GitHub. GitHub accounts are free, and will continue to be so after you leave university, unlike Microsoft 365. Moreover, version control is a central focus of most professional endeavors, and getting a better grasp of it, even if you are forced to go back to *Track Changes* in Word, is an essential part of your education in this course.


## Institutional Necessities

One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this:

### Emergency Evacuation Procedures

A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and "Designated Rescue Area." Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor.

### Accessibility Services, Disability Services, & Other Helpful People

The university maintains a wide variety of services and centers designed to help students who have either ongoing or emergent needs. Please do not hesitate to contact [Academic Support Services](http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services), and don’t be embarrassed to talk to me.


## Course Agenda

Please note two things: while the table below suggests that this course follows a fixed, calendrical schedule, it is labeled an agenda for a good reason: sometimes discussions move more quickly or more slowly and schedules change. If you miss class, reach out to one of your fellow participants to ascertain where we are in the agenda. 

In most cases, the direct link to an article or other kind of resource is posted below, save items on Moodle. In a number of instances, the direct link is to JSTOR, since that is where a number of folklore studies journals are archived. Please see the note on [accessing materials](guides/access.md) for more information on successfully accessing databases and data repositories.

## Resources

A lot of collections of "American folklore" have been published over the years, each with its own assumptions about both "America" and "folklore" as well as what the purpose of such a collection should be. Typical of one kind of collection are those by Charles Skinner, whose _Myths and Legends of Our Own Land_ reaches 9 volumes. A more synthetic, and more contemporary, reference can be found in the _American Folklore: An Encyclopedia_, edited by Jan Brunvand, a copy of which is available in the university library (Reference GR101.A54). While dated by contemporary scholarly perspectives, the collection of essays in Don Yoder’s _American Folklife_ (GR105.A6) is still quite useful, and foundational in many ways.

In addition to reference works focused on the topic of American folklore, there are a myriad of other specialist reference works, many of which are available either in electronic formats or in the library for your use. Consider the following titles: _The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore_, _Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife_, the _Encyclopedia of Life Writing_, _The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife_ are all the kinds of entry-level texts, being encyclopedias, that will be familiar to your freshman/sophomore self but will also get your junior/senior/graduate self on the road to more serious and substantial work. That is, in addition to a synthesis/summary of a topic from a particular perspective, most scholarly encyclopedias also offer a small number of suggested readings. Please follow through on those readings the way you would a link on a web page.

## Possible Readings

Perceptive readers have, no doubt, noted to themselves that there appears to be a hole in the middle of the agenda/schedule/whatever: a whole series of class periods with no topic nor readering assigned. That gap is assignments is meant as an opening for the class, as a group, and me, as an instructor responding to the nature of that group, to decide where our interests lie. Online vernacular cultures cover a wide gamut of forms and the theory required to understand and analyze them is, if anything, even wider, including as it does work in anthropology, cognitive science, data science, folklore studies, information science, linguistics, and network science to name just a few of the fields active in this area (and naming them alphabetically at that). 

What follows below is something of a list of the possible things we might read.

### Online Folklore / Vernacular Expression

Fine, Gary Alan and Bill Ellis. 2010. _The Global Grapevine: Why Rumors of Terrorism, Immigration, and Trade Matter_. Oxford University Press. DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199736317.001.0001.

> The chapter on conspiracy theories in **Ellis and Fine 2010** seems almost precognizant of the current moment. 

Peck, Andrew, and Trevor J. Blank, eds. 2020. _Folklore and Social Media_. University Press of Colorado. http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv19fvx6q.

> **Peck and Blank 2020** is composed of 12 chapters, each of which is on a different topic in online vernacular culture. For those interested, two of those essays are computationally-driven, the one on "Bridges, Sex Slaves, Tweets, and Guns: A Multi-Domain Model of Conspiracy Theory" by Tim Tangherlini, Vwani Roychowdhury and Peter M. Broadwell and the one on "The Clown Legend Cascade of 2016" by yours truly. The chapter on "Overt and Covert Aspects of Virtual Play" by Bill Ellis pairs really well with a [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8Dd5aVXLCc) by the at-the-time CEO of Cambridge Analytica.


### Information

Shannon, Claud and Warren Weaver. 1949. _The Mathematical Theory of Communication_. University of Illinois Press. 

> **Shannon and Weaver 1949** is the foundational mathematical treatment of information. 

Gleick, James. 2011. _The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood_. Vintage Books.

### Networks

Golub, Benjamin, and Matthew Jackson. 2012. How Homophily Affects the Speed of Learning and Best-Response Dynamics. _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ 127 (3): 1287–1338. 

Ferguson, Niall. 2017. _The Square and the Tower: Networks and Power, from the Freemasons to Facebook_. Penguin Books. 

> Ferguson is a bit out of his depth, and the book's argument doesn't really hold together -- but, hey, when you're Niall Ferguson, you don't need cogent arguments any more -- but the first few chapters are useful condensations, by a non-network scientist, of developments in network studies. 


### Cultural Analytics 

Computational approaches to humanities topics and objects go by a number of different names for various historical, political, and weird reasons. The usual umbrella term is *digital humanities*, and if you are interested you might start there. *Cultural analytics*, sometimes also *culture analytics* (because feudalism is still rampant), is a subset of digital humanities focused on computational analyses, some of which seek to re-create conventional or traditional humanities studies but many of which seek to ask new kinds of questions. You may also find work with *computational* added in front of a well-established domain: e.g., computational folkloristics, computational literary studies, computational social sciences. In linguistics, a lot of this work has been pioneered within *corpus linguistics* and/or *corpus stylistics* -- the latter is particularly worth exploring because a lot of interesting experiments have occurred under its aegis. 

For those curious to survey what has been done and what is being done, there is no better place to start than with the journals:

* Scholarship
* Digital Humanities Quarterly
* Journal of Cultural Analytics
