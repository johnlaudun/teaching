* Burke, Kenneth. 1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In _The Philosophy of Literary Form_, 293-304. University of California Press. [URL](texts/Burke_1941.pdf).


### Matters of "Fact"

As [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Universe_Changed) notes:

> _The Day the Universe Changed_ is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 in [Spring] 1985 by the BBC [and rebroadcast on PBS in Autumn 1986]. The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one's perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present.

(Wikipedia also has a nice entry on the [printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press).)



### Legend Foundations

Bascom, William. 1965. The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives. _Journal of American Folklore_ 78: 3-20. [JSTOR](http://jstor.org/stable/538099).

*For more on possible ways to consider the inter-relationships of the forms of folklore see also*: Littleton, C. Scott. 1965. A Two-Dimensional Scheme for the Classification of Narratives. _Journal of American Folklore_ 78(307): 21-27. DOI: 10.2307/538100. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/538100).

*Another essay that works well with Bascom's "Forms of Folklore" is his essay on the four functions of folklore*: Bascom, William. 1953. Four Functions of Folklore. _Journal of American Folklore_ 66(262): 333-349. DOI: 10.2307/536411. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/536411).

Langlois, Janet. 2005. "Celebrating Arabs": Tracing Legend and Rumor Labyrinths in Post-9/11 Detroit. _Journal of American Folklore_ 118/468: 219-236. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4137703).

If you're observant, then you might have noticed that Langlois' essay is tagged as part of JSTOR's [Security Studies](https://www.jstor.org/security-studies/) collection. It's worth taking a look: the landing page is not very informative, but if you search for something like *rumor* than you get a very nice history of its study represented in the search results. (If you are interested in the history of Arab-Americans in Louisiana, see ["Roots of the Cedar: The Lebanese Heritage in Louisiana"](http://www.louisianafolklife.org/LT/Articles_Essays/lebanese.html).)

### Legends as Performances

In addition to thinking about folklore *qua* texts, folklorists have also developed a robust model of folklore as transactional in nature: folklore was "equipment for living" (Kenneth Burke) or folklore as a way to get social business done. Some describe this as a contextual approach, but the term most often associated with it is performance. The articles below focus on the nature of contexts:

Bauman, Richard. 1972. The La Have Island General Store: Sociability and Verbal Art in a Nova Scotia Community. Journal of American Folklore 85(338): 330-343. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/539322).

## Understanding the Information Age

To understand the what we think of as the information age, we'll need to go back a bit and make sure we understand the previous era, The Media Age, for lack of a better name. And that's why we begin with Marshal McLuhan.

Carpenter, Edmund, and Marshall McLuhan. 1956. “The New Languages.” Chicago Review 10(1): 46–52. DOI: 10.2307/25293194
[JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25293194).

McLuhan, Marshall. 1959. “Myth and Mass Media.” Daedalus 88(2): 339–48. [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20026500).

McLuhan, Marshall. 1968. “Instructional Media: Is Book Dead.” The Clearing House 42(7): 447–48. [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/30183384).

In the essay, Dorst references the film _Style Wars_. There is both an official [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ReyiYUPsEs), as well as a range of [unofficial videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=style+wars), one of which seems to include [outtakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4u5OY0LgE50) from the film.

### Fake News

Temming, Maria. 2018. People are bad at spotting fake news. Can computer programs do better? _Science News_ (July 26). [URL](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/can-computer-programs-flag-fake-news).


## Some Case Studies to Get You Working

Do *not* forget that while a particular article may not be useful to you, articles in the same journal may very well be. *Always browse*. (And that includes this syllabus! Consider looking at some of the links below for Ellis or on Fake News or on Slender Man -- there's a lot here for you to consider.)

Limor Shifman, Hadar Levy, Mike Thelwall. 2014. Internet Jokes: The Secret Agents of Globalization? _Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication_ 19/4,1: 727–743. [URL](https://doi.org/10.1111/jcc4.12082).

Shifman has also worked on *memes*: [this review][] will tell you more, and you can follow the leads to get access to the text. Folklorists have long worked on memes, and you might consider the results of [this search][].

If you're interested in *fake news*, then you are in luck. There was an entire issue of the _Journal of American Folklore_ focused on fake news: [JAF 131/522](https://muse.jhu.edu/issue/39305). For another approach, see:

## Interlude: Ellis' _Aliens, Ghosts, and Cults_

Greste, Peter. 2017. _Facebook: Cracking the Code_. ThoughtMaybe. [Link](https://thoughtmaybe.com/facebook-cracking-the-code/).

> Facebook is an enormously powerful corporation, harnessing both the self-disclosed and gleaned personal data of over 2 billion people. Its user-base is larger than the population of any country. The company is all pervasive online, tracking and profiling users and non-users alike. Cracking the Code looks at the insides of this giant machine and how Facebook turns your thoughts and behaviours into profits—whether you like it or not. And it’s not just a one-way transaction either. Cracking the Code also explains how Facebook uses vast troves of web data to manipulate the way you think and feel, as well as act—all in the sole interests of Facebook, masquerading as “community.” What are the social implications of this—when one company basically controls the insights and experiences of the entire online world, with extremely personalised and targeted social and behavioural engineering on a scale never before seen?

Origgi, Gloria. 2018. Say goodbye to the information age: it’s all about reputation now. _Aeon_ (March 14). [URL](https://aeon.co/ideas/say-goodbye-to-the-information-age-its-all-about-reputation-now).

> We are experiencing a fundamental paradigm shift in our relationship to knowledge. From the ‘information age’, we are moving towards the ‘reputation age’, in which information will have value only if it is already filtered, evaluated and commented upon by others. Seen in this light, reputation has become a central pillar of collective intelligence today. It is the gatekeeper to knowledge, and the keys to the gate are held by others. The way in which the authority of knowledge is now constructed makes us reliant on what are the inevitably biased judgments of other people, most of whom we do not know.

### Joking and Socializing

To go along with our reading of Zora Neale Hurston's _Mules and Men_:

* Hurston singing ["Uncle Bud"](http://biblioklept.org/2009/02/27/zora-neale-hurston-sings-uncle-bud/). And here's Boozoo Chavis singing ["Uncle Bud"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEgbfXdzb28), keeping the ribald nature of the song alive and well. (Feel free to click on the links for live versions of the song, including one by, I think, a Japanese zydeco band.)
* And a collection of Hurston singing [a variety of folk songs](https://www.floridamemory.com/audio/hurston.php).
* When Zora sings in Polk County she sings ["John Henry"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore))(link is to Wikipedia article for those who don't know the story/history of the song.) If you want to see what railroad looked like throughout much of the twentieth century, especially in the South, have a look at ["Gandy Dancers'](https://youtu.be/3r_cI3kYYhM), a 1973 film documentary.
* If you don't know what a work song sounds like, then this version of ["Rosie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmMyPVLqyzE), recorded by the Lomaxes at Mississippi State Prison in Parchman is as good a place as any to start understanding a much broader folk song tradition than we will have time to address in this course.
* There is also this upload of Bill Ferris' ["I Ain't Lying"](https://youtu.be/Smwr24UCRXo). Watch the first five minutes at least.


### Impersonations

If you consider the root of impersonation, you are confronted with the idea of being in another person for the sake, quite often, of humor. But, as the Apache point out, no matter what your intent, there are always multiple possibilities whenever you dwell elsewhere. (In some way, the argument for reading is that by being (in) others while reading, we are allowing ourselves to imagine, simultaneously, what it is like to be someone else *and* what it is like not to be ourselves. Both of those are very powerful questions -- and that is why, perhaps, we usually contain impersonations within a humorous frame.

For the next class, please read the following four pieces, three of which are really quite short. Only the Dundes is an essay-long consideration of ethnic humor. The short note that follows the Dundes below, considers how the light bulb joke begins in ethnic humor but visits other topics.

Please read in the order listed:

Accents, in speech, can be considered one facet of stereotypes. Here are some [Irish people doing North American accents](https://youtu.be/JVjL0i74Drw).



*I think we are going to skip this next session on treasure legends and go to contemporary legends, what are often called "urban legends" or "urban myths."*

### Treasure Tales

This essay from Hurley represents folklore scholarship from the late forties. Be aware that there is some outdated language here. The essay itself is only 8 pages long. The rest of the entry is 102 summaries of treasure tales.

Hurley, Gerard T. 1951. Buried Treasure Tales in America. _Western Folklore_ 10/3: 197-216. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1496333).

Mullen introduces us to the notion of a "folk idea", something we will explore in the weeks ahead.

Mullen, Patrick B. 1978. The Folk Idea of Unlimited Good in American Buried Treasure Legends. _Journal of the Folklore Institute_ 15/3: 209-220. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3813976).

This is the one time that I will, as a professor, make you read my own writing. I am doing so both because our topic is treasure legends and the paper offered here is on Louisiana treasure legends but also because as something written early in the stages of a research project it has plenty of flaws and gaps.
