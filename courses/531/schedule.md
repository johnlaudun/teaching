# 531 Seminar Schedule

Our own interests, expertise, and discoveries will determine more clearly how we will actually spend our time. For those reasons, I prefer to establish an agenda for a course, with the proviso that how much we dwell on a topic or gloss it will effect the timing of matters. While the sequencing of topics should remain fairly stable, the fulfillment of those topics through various readings will be determined by the content of our conversations.

Please note that the schedule below will change according to the needs of the course and its participants. If you must miss a class meeting, please make sure to contact someone from the course to verify what happened and where we are in the schedule. (If Teams is working, you may feel free to post there. Conversely, if you are checking Teams and you see someone has asked about something in class, please answer their question.)

## Schedule in Full-ish

### Seminar Introductions

On the first day of the course we go over all the usual course dimensions, reviewing the syllabus as we do so. There will also be some preliminary introductions of participants, and, should the moment arise, a brief discussion about the nature of **texts**. 

**January 18**. *"Story" and "Narrative"*. There are a lot of definitions of culture and folklore out "there." In this class, we discuss some of them and begin to build a useful synthesis of those terms, the first of many, on which we can all rely. **Assigned**: Participants are divided into two groups, each group focused on one of the two terms. Each participant is responsible for collecting one definition from the kinds of sources discussed in class — so, yes, googling "what is culture?" is going to be ruled *low effort / low reward*. Each entry should be 25-100 words in length and should be accompanied by a citation as well as a brief rationale (another 25-100 words) that explains why it is a viable or useful definition. Each of these items should appear as a separate block in the document you bring to class and/or share with others.

**January 25**. 

**February 1**. 

**February 8**. 

**February 15**.

*There are no class meetings during Mardi Gras break. Enjoy!*

### A Bayesian Introduction to Narrative Studies

**Part 1**. *Narrative* and *story* get used a lot. For our first meeting, after we review the syllabus and introduce ourselves, we will discuss examples of the two that you bring in from out in the world. Each participant should bring in at least three usages, quotations. To make it easier to share, please copy and paste them into a document that you can then print out and bring 10 copies. We will cut one copy into individual quotations (so if your quotations run more than a page, please make sure each appears on a page). We will then sort the quotations/usages into groups of our own devising, based on similarities in emergent traits. Each participant should bring in at least three examples. Try to vary the nature of the examples: make at least one scholarly and/or formal; make one from a popular source -- and not everyone can use Wikipedia!

**Part 2**.The first task in any course with some dimension of intellectual history as its focus is to try to understand the overall history of the domain. Narrative, however, is a relatively recent locus for organizing scholarly and scientific investigation. Prior to its development as a subject of study in the twentieth century, narrative was largely viewed through a lens of other objects -- tragic plays, novels, myths. While a seminar of this nature could spend a considerable amount of time in the period prior to the formalist-structuralist articulation of narrative as an object in its own right, we are going to bounce around a bit, hoping, in some shadow of Bayes, to locate ourselves through apparent random pings in the great depths of intellectual history.

We begin with two readings, one a narrative and one a scholarly examination:

McConnell, Richard. 1924\. The Most Dangerous Game. _Collier's_. [Moodle].

> For those interested in the sheer volume of adaptations of the story, the [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game) for the short story has a decent, if not complete (because impossible), list.

Schiffrin, Deborah. 2009\. Crossing Boundaries: The Nexus of Time, Space, Person, and Place in Narrative. _Language in Society_ 38 (4): 421–45\. DOI:10.1017/S0047404509990212\. [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20622659).

Finally, before we leap into our own exploration of the development of narrative studies, it won't hurt to read some surveys and develop some sense of the larger landscape. For this, there are two encyclopedias, one you know and one you are less likely to know. The first entry for "Narratology" is in [Wikipedia][wp], and the second in the [Living Handbook of Narratology][lhn]. The former is short; the latter long.

### Unitizing Narrative: Motifs & Functions

Before we examine Propp's work, it's important to understand the larger dialogue in which he is engaging. Specifically, early in _Morphology_, Propp notes that "the study of the tale has been pursued for the most part only genetically, and, to a great extent, without attempts at preliminary, systematic description" (5). _Genetic_ references the great philological collection projects of the nineteenth century that were, for the most part, focused on origins and originals. In the twentieth century, that focus would become what is now known as the historic-geographic method, and its most noted accomplishment are the great indices of folklore studies: the tale-type index and the motif index. The best way to understand them is to use them. (More on genetic matters below.)

#### The Indices

The Aarne-Thompson-Uther classification system is available on-line as part of the [Multilingual Folk Tale Database](http://www.mftd.org/index.php). A concise explanation of the ATU system is offered [here](http://oaks.nvg.org/folktale-types.html).

In preparation for actually using the two iconic folklore indices, I would suggest the following reading:

Again, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(folkloristics)) is not a terrible place to start. And there are two other online sources that are worth your time:

Richard Kuehnel and Rado Lencek. [What is a Folklore Motif?](https://www.aktuellum.com/mobile/slavic/folklore-motif/)

[How to use Thompson's Folklore Motif Index](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Content/Motif_Help.htm)

Two of the Grimms tales are available entirely in plain text for your use: [Grimms 91](texts/grimms_91.md), sometimes titled as "The Gnome" and sometimes as "The Elves" and ["Jack and the Fire Dragon"](texts/hicks_2.md) as told by Ray Hicks.

This seminar would be remiss if you did not read about the idea of _motif_ from the compiler himself, Stith Thompson. I have also included Angela Maniak's short introduction to the role of the role of indexes, or indices, and bibliographies in classical forms of scholarship for those less acquainted with them. Finally, the long essay by Dan Ben-Amos is for those committed to understanding the nuances of folklore studies' intellectual history.

Thompson, Stith. 1949\. Motif. In _Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend_, 753\. Eds. Maria Leach and Jerome Fried. Funk and Wagnalls. [Moodle].

Maniak, Angela. 1983\. Bibliographies and Indexes in American Folklore Research. In Handbook of American Folklore, ed. Richard Dorson, 447-451\. Indiana University Press. [Moodle].

Ben-Amos, Dan. 1980\. The Concept of Motif in Folklore. In Folklore studies in the Twentieth Century: Proceedings of the Centenary Conference of the Folklore Society, ed. Venetia Newall, 17-36\. Rowman and Littlefield. [Moodle].

A slightly different approach to unitizing narrative, but proceeding along the same lines as the historic-geographic school, can be found in the work of [Jamshid J. Tehrani](https://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology/staff/academic/?id=5388), who has parsed narratives into _traits_ that look a lot like motifs and then attempted phylogenetic analysis on variations on a text to see which are more closely related. His analysis takes place against a backdrop of history and cultural geography.

Graça da Silva, S. & Tehrani, J. J. 2016\. Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales. _Royal Society Open Science_ 3(1): 150645\. DOI: 10.1098/rsos.150645\. [URL](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.150645)

Tehrani, J. J. 2013\. The Phylogeny of Little Red Riding Hood. _PLoS ONE_ 8(11): e78871\. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078871\. [URL](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0078871).

#### Propp

The intertwined, and yet not intersecting, history of motifs and functions is not one on which I can comment. Structuralists outside folklore studies never took up the motif, and folkorists, while fascinated with function, never developed the idea much. Propp's Morphology, however, has enjoyed a renaissance of late. (It is perhaps because the kinds of data and analysis needed for structuralism has finally come to be -- see Miranda for more.)

Propp, Vladimir. 1968\. _Morphology of the Folktale_. Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. [Moodle].

And here are some [Louisiana legends](texts/legends.md) to consider. (For a text analytical perspective, the corpus is also on [Voyant-Tools][])

[Voyant-Tools]: https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=542be74058f3710c6026a1e81a763502&panels=collocatesgraph,reader,trends,summary,bubblelines

Contemporary considerations of Propp include:

Fisseni, Bernhard, Aadil Kurji, and Benedikt Löwe. 2014\. Annotating with Propp's Morphology of the Folktale: Reproducibility and Trainability. _Literary and Linguistic Computing_ 29(4): 488-510\. [Moodle].

Hansen, Gregory. 2015\. Computerizing Propp's Morphology: A Forward-Thinking Retrospect on Structuralism. _New Directions in Folklore_ 13(1/2): 3-43\. [Moodle].

The motif is one of those things that seems old-fashioned and yet has renewed interest in the era of data science (for a variety of reasons). In computer science, [Mark Finlayson](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~markaf/) has done some remarkable work -- see his profile page for a complete bibliography -- but those works directly related to Propp are below. (Please note that computer science, like the sciences in general, is really good about making their work easily accessible: the obsession with tying any work up with protections is the best path to obscurity, literal and figurative.) The 2009 paper was my introduction to his work, but please note that the first publication listed is in the _Journal of American Folklore_:

And, finally, there is a cognitive dimension:

### The Other Structuralism

For those familiar with Claude Lévi-Strauss, it might surprise you to learn that while his early work on kinship had established him in the academy, his rise to star status actually emerged from his memoir, _Tristes Tropiques_, published in the same year, 1955, as "The Structural Study of Myth" (below). The essay was one stepping stone -- others are collected in _Structural Anthropology_ -- to his longer treatment of myth in _La Pensée Sauvage_ (1964, translated as _The Savage Mind_ in English, which, as is usual for translations of Levi-Strauss, and later Derrida, misses the linguistic play often at the heart of his writing).

Levi-Strauss, Claude. 1955. The Structural Study of Myth. _Journal of American Folklore_ 68 (270): 428–44. DOI: 10.2307/536768. [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/536768).

For those interested, Lévi-Strauss addresses Propp's work directly in the essay below -- the first 8 pages are essentially his summary of _Morphology_ before he begins to offer his own views.

### Classical Narratology

While we will return to the idea that narratives are a distinct form of discourse, or a particular mode of discursive production, if you prefer, Barthes' "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives" captures some of the spirit of one of the pivotal moments in the shaping of narrative as a subject of study and will, for many participants, give some hint of what the formalist-structuralist paradigm looks like. Barthes' "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives" first appeared in _Communications_ 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in _NLH_ in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in _Image Music Text_, published in 1977.) _Communications_ was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).

Most page references you will see elsewhere are usually to the version published in _SiL_, which I is also available on Moodle, but the advantage of the larger collection of Jakobson's work is that it also contains his essay on "The Dominant" and the essay he co-wrote with Yuri Tynjanov on "Problems in the Study of Language and Literature."

### Outside the Tower

One of the reasons for this course is the immense amount of discourse focused on _stories_ and _storytelling_ that takes places outside the academy. Some of it, as we have seen, is just that _story_ is the current buzzword, much like _paradigm_ and/or _box_ were in a previous moment. There is, however, a lot of very smart thinking about the shapes of stories taking place. TVTropes is one venue, but writers, readers, and critics of genre fiction also have some very interesting, and often quite compelling things to note about the nature of narrative. One place to start is this analysis of the final battle in the middle movie of _The Lord of the Rings_ trilogy, aka Helms Deep. The Nerdwriter's analysis includes the notion of [beats], something you will find used elsewhere.

## Resources

_The lists below are by no means comprehensive, only suggestive. If you find something that should be added here, please let me know._

### Journals

Please note that the hyperlinks for JSTOR and Project Muse take you directly to the journal's main page and not the home page of those two services.

The _Journal of Narrative Theory_ appears to be the oldest journal focused specifically on narrative. Founded in 1971 as the _Journal of Narrative Technique_, JNT "has provided a forum for the theoretical exploration of narrative in all its forms. Building on this foundation, JNT publishes essays addressing the epistemological, global, historical, formal, and political dimensions of narrative from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives." JNT is available on-line through Project Muse.

_Narrative_ is "the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Narrative's broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance art." The Society's website is: <http://narrative.georgetown.edu/>. Online access to articles is available through Project Muse (2002-present). Issues prior to 2002 are available through JSTOR.

_Storyworlds_ is a new, interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. It features research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, studied from perspectives developed in such fields as narratology, discourse analysis, jurisprudence, philosophy, cognitive and social psychology, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, and the study of organizations." Current journal contents and contact information are available at <http://storyworlds.osu.edu>. The journal is available on-line on Project Muse.

In addition to these journals focused narrowly on narrative, there are journals that address narrative specifically but from a particular perspective. Obviously most, if not all, of the journals with which you are familiar in the fields of composition, folklore, or literary studies will include narrative as part of their purview, but you may also want to take a look at a few other journals that you, perhaps, would not normally encounter, such as _Discourse Processes_ or _Genre_.

### Special Issues

In Autumn 1980, _Critical Inquiry_ 7(1) released a special issue entitled simply: On Narrative. (URL: <http://www.jstor.org/stable/i257724>.) The table of contents reads like a who's who of scholars from the era:

### Before Our Beginning

As noted elsewhere, prior to the twentieth century, interested commentators were more focused on narrative's manifestations in various forms of discourse, as is the case with Aristotle's concern with the nature of tragedy in the plays of his day. Aristotle's _Poetics_ are available in a number of locations: [Project Perseus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0056) has an authoritative edition of Aristotle's Poetics which is generously annotated but requires you to be online and [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6763) has a variety of formats which can easily be downloaded for offline viewing.
