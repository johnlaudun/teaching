*This is in transition. Read at your peril (of confusion).*

Work on the course project typically begins right at the mid-semester mark, with the development of a research proposal. Deadlines for each of the elements below will be provided in class and in our messaging setup. You are always welcome to submit early, and every effort will be made to get you as much feedback as you like. 

The parameters below are for the final product: there is no expectation that you will have this many words, or perhaps that many examples, when you start -- though, to be honest, having many examples to start is better.

* As a folklorist, I study anecdotes. Anecdotes are the stuff of life. They can even be objects of study. You just can't work with anecdotal evidence, in the sense that a small number of examples â€”- sometimes only one -- drawn from personal experience can serve as your data. It's perfectly fine to let your personal experience draw you towards an object of study, but once you have established that object, you need to collect (and analyze) objectively and purposefully, not casually, anecdotally. The minimum number of examples for any project is **10**.
* The initial proposal should be ~100 words and provide its audience with the materials to be considered and some idea of what makes them compelling to think about (and, later, to read about).
* The final word count, barring any included texts and their basic description, is 1500. 1500 words of solid analytical and conceptual prose with plenty of accommodations for rich, meaningful descriptions and pattern discovery. (Please do not narrate your research process save as a way to start your essay or to conclude it.)
* The final presentation should be 3-5 minutes in length and it should provide the audience with the essentials: the scope of the research, the conclusions drawn, and how those conclusions were reached (what was the data, how was it examined, what additional materials or concepts were found to be necessary). This will accompany a poster of your own creation. (Templates will be provided.) Poster sessions will be scheduled either for the library or for somewhere else on campus. 

### Documentation of a Digital Artifact

* The artifact itself must be appropriately and fully captured at its native resolution or higher and in a share-able format: JPG is acceptable for images, though PNG is better -- professional researchers rely on TIFF. This goes for textual materials as well: their native context should be captured either as a partial screen capture on the web site or as a capture of the browser window. (No one wants to see your entire desktop, trust me.) If capturing a browser window, insure there are no embarrassing tabs to be seen. (In other words, don't make yourself a meme.)
* Record the URL and relevant metadata like date and time of access -- feel free to add the platform used.
* Describe the artifact in your own words such that a reader need not see it to understand what it is. This may mean significant re-typing of verbal information,be it audio or textual, or time spent describing an image or video sequence.

### Some Prompts

There are many ways to make presentations more compelling. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 

* _Scientific American_'s [60-Second Science](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/old-art-offers-agriculture-info/) series is billed as a podcast, and thus depends upon audio, but episodes regularly feature visuals -- usually just one, and it's not a slide of bullet points but more often an image or a graph which is explained during the course of the episode.
* Multi-panel comic. 
* Timeline of/with images.
* miniTEDtalk
* _Horrible Histories_ sometimes features [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDy4oBa2jyM).
