# Digital Folklore and Culture

ENGL 334-001 / MW 1430-1545 / HLG 321 / [Schedule](schedule.md)

[Pr. John Laudun](https://johnlaudun.net/) / HLG 356 / MW 1200-1400 & by appointment


## Description

Memes, fake news, trolling, rickrolling are all well-established forms of internet behavior and are as much a part of our everyday lives as grandma's gumbo. **English 334: Digital Folklore and Culture** explores the varieties and depths of digital cultures, from the first email forwards to the latest tiktoks and everything in between. Course activities include curating collections of digital materials; learning how to parse digital content; annotating, sorting, and compiling data sets; applying appropriate analytical frameworks; and exploring ways to present your ideas effectively. The final project focuses on an online collection and a poster session.

## Objectives

Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific analyses of human behavior with a special emphasis on online behaviors and then apply definitions, models, or analytical concepts in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in an appropriate structure.

## Texts

A considerable amount of reading for this course are scholarly materials, mostly as PDFs, available either in on-line databases, like JSTOR, or through the course’s Moodle site. Many of the materials in the latter instance are already uploaded, and so if there is a moment in the course where an item is listed on the schedule but does not appear in the Resources section of the course’s Moodle page, please contact me. (Do not assume because you cannot find something that you are not responsible for it.)

At present, I am only considering one book as a required purchase for this course: Gretchen McCulloch's _Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language_. More on this soon.

In addition to the texts we encounter in class, there are other resources that may be useful to those either in need of a bit more discussion or seeking to expand their understanding. JSTOR, for example, offers a variety of tutorials: some are [simply slides or texts][] that you can read on your own and others are [interactive tutorials][] hosted on their own Moodle setup. (Registration is required, but once you are registered, you’ll discover a number of short videos as well as interactive exercises. If you allocate 20 minutes per session for a few days, you’ll learn something.)

In case you are unclear, there is a difference between [primary and secondary sources][] in many fields, though the distinction can be blurry in disciplines, like folklore studies and cultural anthropology, that create their own source materials.

## Requirements

As an upper-division course, this course assumes all participants are already familiar with accessing and using scholarly and scientific materials in both print and on-line forms. If not, then your first course of action is to take a library tutorial. (See also the guide on [how to access JSTOR](./guides/access.md), and other resources, from off campus.) It also assumes you are familiar with the University’s Code of Conduct. This class is conducted as if we are are all professionals engaged in a mutually rewarding endeavor to which all of us contribute in order to succeed. That means coming prepared, not being distracted, and being engaged with not only the course materials but also each other.

The schedule of graded assignments is:

* **Participation** (20%) requires active participation in discussions and activities. An important dimension of learning is voicing your ideas either orally or in writing, which is often far easier in conversation than it is in the more formal setting of an assignment. Use these opportunities to your best advantage. I try to use a variety of activities, and discussion formats, in class meetings to help balance those with preferences for extroversion with those for preferences for introversion. (If you have particular ideas or suggestions about what might work best for you and/or others, please feel free to pass those along.)
* **Quizzes / Exams** (40%): A lot of recent work in learning has suggeted that regular testing of things recently learned is the best way to improve recall and facility. This semester this course is using weekly quizzes to explore how well that works. Each week a quiz will be given. At the end of the quiz, if you feel confident in your answers, you may turn it in for credit. Sufficient number of correctly-answered weekly quizzes will make either of the exams, mid-term and final, optional. If you would prefer to hold onto your quiz for personal review, you are free to do so. Answers will be provided after the quiz -- in some cases later in the class meeting and in others the next meeting -- so that you can check your understanding. The two exams, then, are each worth 20% and ask you to take concepts and methods taken from the readings and apply them in a very constrained way to novel examples, to examples from another reading, or from your own work. If you've kept up with the reading, lectures, and discussions, these are pretty straightforward. 
* **Projects** (40%): Drawing upon the ideas, forms, and materials we have discussed this course expects you to strike out on your own, gathering your own data, perhaps even data sets, analyzing it, and bringing appropriate (and novel) ideas and concepts to bear. Each of the projects is a small research project based on a genre we have studied and which you then go collect. Presentation formats vary, but the capstone project is a poster to be displayed either in H.L. Griffin or in Dupre Library. (More on this later.)

### Course Project

Work on the course project typically begins right at the mid-semester mark, with the development of a research proposal. Deadlines for each of the elements below will be provided in class and in our messaging setup. You are always welcome to submit early, and every effort will be made to get you as much feedback as you like. 

The parameters below are for the final product: there is no expectation that you will have this many words, or perhaps that many examples, when you start -- though, to be honest, having many examples to start is better.

* As a folklorist, I study anecdotes. Anecdotes are the stuff of life. They can even be objects of study. You just can't work with anecdotal evidence, in the sense that a small number of examples —- sometimes only one -- drawn from personal experience can serve as your data. It's perfectly fine to let your personal experience draw you towards an object of study, but once you have established that object, you need to collect (and analyze) objectively and purposefully, not casually, anecdotally. The minimum number of examples for any project is **10**.
* The initial proposal should be ~100 words and provide its audience with the materials to be considered and some idea of what makes them compelling to think about (and, later, to read about).
* The final word count, barring any included texts and their basic description, is 1500. 1500 words of solid analytical and conceptual prose with plenty of accommodations for rich, meaningful descriptions and pattern discovery. (Please do not narrate your research process save as a way to start your essay or to conclude it.)
* The final presentation should be 3-5 minutes in length and it should provide the audience with the essentials: the scope of the research, the conclusions drawn, and how those conclusions were reached (what was the data, how was it examined, what additional materials or concepts were found to be necessary). This will accompany a poster of your own creation. (Templates will be provided.) Poster sessions will be scheduled either for the library or for somewhere else on campus. 

### Documentation of a Digital Artifact

* The artifact itself must be appropriately and fully captured at its native resolution or higher and in a share-able format: JPG is acceptable for images, though PNG is better -- professional researchers rely on TIFF. This goes for textual materials as well: their native context should be captured either as a partial screen capture on the web site or as a capture of the browser window. (No one wants to see your entire desktop, trust me.) If capturing a browser window, insure there are no embarrassing tabs to be seen. (In other words, don't make yourself a meme.)
* Record the URL and relevant metadata like date and time of access -- feel free to add the platform used.
* Describe the artifact in your own words such that a reader need not see it to understand what it is. This may mean significant re-typing of verbal information,be it audio or textual, or time spent describing an image or video sequence.

### Some Prompts

There are many ways to make presentations more compelling. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 

* _Scientific American_'s [60-Second Science](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/old-art-offers-agriculture-info/) series is billed as a podcast, and thus depends upon audio, but episodes regularly feature visuals -- usually just one, and it's not a slide of bullet points but more often an image or a graph which is explained during the course of the episode.
* Multi-panel comic. 
* Timeline of/with images.
* miniTEDtalk
* _Horrible Histories_ sometimes features [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDy4oBa2jyM). 





## Contact Information

Do not hesitate. Immediately look around where you are sitting and get the name and number of two responsible looking people. Not the cute one — because getting his or her number that way would be just creepy, but someone who has at least your level of maturity, if not higher. Write that information below so that when you do have to miss class, then you can contact them about what you missed.
