# Courses

These are the courses in which I am currently involved:

* [English 115](115/index.md): Honors Academic Writing
* [English 332](332/index.md): Introduction to Folk Narrative
* [English 334](334/index.md): Digital Folklore and Culture
<!-- * [English 335](courses/335/index.md): Louisiana Folklore -->
* [English 432](432/index.md): America in Legend Online and Off
* [English 531](531/index.md): Seminar in Narrative Studies
* [English 632](632/index.md): Proseminar in Folklore Theory

And these are courses I am in the process of designing and imagine teaching in a context where both close and distant reading, where both computation and cogitation, feature equally in the treatment of texts.

* [Introduction to Text Analytics](c200/index.md)
* [What We Think When We Think about Machine Thinking](c300/index.md)
* [The Spread of (Mis)Information](c400/index.md)

While I have never taught these courses as they are sketched out here, they are based on units or features of courses or workshops I have conducted.
