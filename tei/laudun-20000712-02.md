It was like ... <pause />

Jenny Jenny crossed the ocean.
Jenny Jenny crossed the sea.
She landed to the little town name of Breadbug.
She walked in the bar.
She said, bartender, bartender give me a piece of meat.
Bartender pulled out a plate with a funky piece of meat.
Say, bartender, do you know who I am?
She said, frankly speaking m’am I don’t give a damn.
So he said one son of a bitch who was in the back stood up and said well let’s hang her.
Another son of a bitch stand up on the other side and he said No, let’s cook her
Said a big tall black guy stood up in the back and said let’s barbecue the motherfucker.
