We just picked it up by listening to people talk. Just sitting around. In the olden days, you couldn’t sit around and look in the old folks’ mouth, you know, because they’d spit in your eye with some ‘bacco or something to get you out the room. Because they didn’t want you to hear their conversations. So as kids, you had your ears to the door. You know what I’m saying? You’d listen to what they was talking about.… They wouldn’t want the kids to hear “motherfucker” and this and that. So they’d be in private, in the house. My daddy and some of his friends and my uncle. They’d gather around on a Sunday and they would play.
