# Hello, World!

If you are reading this, then either you know how to glimpse the wizard behind the curtain or else you came here via another brick road. (Not all bricks are yellow.)

This ReadMe is part of a larger repository of teaching materials that are mostly intended to produce a Github Pages site without using Jekyll on my local machine.
