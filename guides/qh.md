# Quantitative / Digital Humanities Resources

Sometimes the problem with getting started is trying to pick a place to start. Maybe you already have a collection of texts, or other kinds of data, that interest you. Maybe you have questions you want to ask, but you donâ€™t know what primary sources might help you to ask that question. 

The fact is that being interested in the quantitative, or digital, humanities can mean all kinds of things. The links below are to help you get started on your own particular journey.

- Miriam Posner teaches at UCLA and has amassed all kinds of useful resources. Check out [her pinboard](https://pinboard.in/u:miriamposner) to glimpse some of the things she has collected and made available.
