In general, it's not a bad idea to start with the [Alliance for Digital Humanities Organization](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/). In addition to making an [on-line version of one of our texts](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/) available, they also offer a [Companion to Digital Literary Studies](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companionDLS/) and a number of other [publications](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/publications) and [resources](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/resources). As you can probably imagine, a lot of resources for the digital humanities are indeed digital and they are on-line. That does not necessarily mean that they are well-organized and that there isn't redundancy and overlap. In an ideal world, perhaps one could search through everything at once, but that moment has not yet arrived. And so, here in somewhat piecemeal fashion but enumerated into a list which makes it all look much better, is a tentative list of what may be considered some of the significant resources in this field:

*   The [Digital Arts and Humanities Bibliography](http://www.arts-humanities.net/bibliography) is maintained by arts-humanities.net. It is searchable and you can also download the complete bibliography as an RTF, Endnote tagged, XML, or a BibTeX file.
*   Another resource is the [Digital Research Tools Wiki](https://digitalresearchtools.pbworks.com/w/page/17801672/FrontPage) which "collects information about tools and resources that can help scholars (particularly in the humanities and social sciences) conduct research more efficiently or creatively.  Whether you need software to help you manage citations, author a multimedia work, or analyze texts, Digital Research Tools will help you find what you're looking for. We provide a directory of tools organized by research activity, as well as reviews of select tools in which we not only describe the tool's features, but also explore how it might be employed most effectively by researchers."
*   Version 2 of the [Digital Curation and Preservation Bibliography](http://digital-scholarship.org/dcpb/dcpb.htm) is now available from Digital Scholarship as an XHTML website with live links to many included works.  This selective bibliography includes over 500 articles, books, and technical reports  that are useful in understanding digital curation and preservation.  All included works are in English.  It is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.

Have digital humanities questions? Then you need [Digital Humanities Answers](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/):

> The goal of [DH Answers](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/) is to create a friendly and inviting space where people can help each other with questions about languages, tools, standards, best practices, pedagogy, and all things related to scholarly activity in the digital humanities (broadly defined). No question is too small, or too simple, or, for that matter, too broad or difficult. The community will answer your question, or help narrow the focus, or simply add to the community knowledgebase. After all, sometimes a question needs more space than a medium like Twitter might offer, and is a little more specific (or basic!) than one might feel comfortable posting on [Humanist](http://digitalhumanities.org/humanist/) or specialist mailing lists.

They are also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dhanswers).
